        <h6>The Theory of Inflation</h6>
        <p class="description">Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the
            universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</p>

                        position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years
                        across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.</p>

                        have traveled the vast distance from one side of the universe to the other, and there has not been
                        enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.</p>

                        look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its
                        temperature and how much it has cooled.</p>

                        direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you
                        see a similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.</p>

                        from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.</p>

                    <p class="infographic-text"><strong>INFLATION</strong> solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less
                        than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light.
                        Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of
                        the universe.</p>

                        left over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</p>

                        inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.</p>
